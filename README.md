# Tenzi

A game that is played using set of 10 dices.

## Intro

Someone says "Go" and everyone rolls at the same time. Quickly look at your roll and decide which number you are going to go for.
For example, if you have more 3's than any other number, that's what you want to go for

Put all your dice with that number aside, collect the remaining dice and quickly roll again

You do not have to wait for others to roll again. Everyone rolls together only on the first roll

Keep rolling until all ten of your dice show the same number

Instead of putting the dices aside here we will hold the each die by clicking on the dice

When clicked on "Roll" the selected dice will not change, but other dices will change to a random dice face between 1-6
